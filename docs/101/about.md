# About the 101 section

101 (pronounced "one-oh-one") is a topic for beginners in any area. It has all the basic principles and concepts that are expected in a particular field.

To fully grasp the power of CWL combined with EO tools and toolboxes, there a few concepts that should be well understood. These are:

- **Containers**: we use containers to run the EO tools and toolboxes. This ensures the portability of the CWL documents created and reduces the tools installation friction

- **YAML**: the YAML (**Y**AML **A**in't **M**arkup **L**anguage) is extensivly used to create CWL documents and associated parameters files. 

- **CWL**: the Common Workflow Language is the main goal of this guide. The CWL 101 provides the basic concepts used in this guide.
